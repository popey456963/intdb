<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Web File Uploader Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

A conventional dictionary is a collection of words, together with explanations of their meanings, hints for their pronunciation, pictures illustrating particular words, examples showing how the words have been used in books and newspapers, and so on.

The OEIS is a collection of sequences of numbers (such as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, …) together with, for each sequence, a list of items such as:

- The first 10, or 10,000, or sometimes 500,000 terms of the sequence
- A definition or description of the sequence
- Comments explaining further properties of the sequence
- Formulas for generating the sequence
- Computer programs for generating the sequence
- References to books and articles where the sequence has appeared
- Links to web pages on the Internet where the sequence has appeared

The OEIS stores over 350,000 entries as of 2023, and is growing rapidly. These sequences come from many sources - books, journals, articles, letters and emails from thousands of contributors.
